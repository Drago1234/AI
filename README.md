# AI

### Sudoku
build a simple AI using constraint propagation and search to solve Sudoku puzzles

### Isolation
build a game-playing AI agent to win the board game Isolation

### Cargo_Route_Planning
use logic, planning and search to implement a system that efficiently moves cargo from their origins to their destinations using the least number of flights

### Sign_Language_to_Text
use Hidden Markov Models to translate sign language into their English language characters

### [Pac-man](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/project_overview.html)
build a Pac-Man AI that finds the most efficient path through its world

* P1 - [Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/search.html): implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

* P2 - [Multi-Agent Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/multiagent.html): implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

* P3 - [Reinforcement Learning](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/reinforcement.html): implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

* P4 - [Ghostbusters](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/tracking.html): implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.   

* P5 - [Classification](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/classification.html): implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits then extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

* P6 - [Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/contest.html): create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.  

### Simulated_Annealing
implement [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) between US state capitals

### Constraint_Satisfaction
use Backtracking to solve the N-queens problem (which is a generalization [8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle))

### Dog_Breed_Classifier
build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

### Time_Series_Prediction_and_Text_Generation
build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first we'll use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!

### Alexa_History_Skill
build a fully functional skill for [Amazon’s Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) that provides year-dated facts from AI History use the [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) - a current state of the art API for building voice systems.  

### NLP_Bookworm
use IBM Watson's NLP Services to create a simple question-answering system

### Mimic_Me
track faces in a video, identify facial expressions (using [Affectiva](http://www.affectiva.com/)’s Emotion-as-a-Service API), and tag each face with an appropriate emoji next to it. Then turn this into a game where the player needs to mimic a random emoji displayed by the computer!

### NLP_Sentiment_Analysis
build an end-to-end sentiment classification system using a combination of RNNs and foundations of NLP
