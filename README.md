# AI

### Sudoku
build a simple AI using constraint propagation and search to solve Sudoku puzzles

### Isolation
build a game-playing AI agent to win the board game Isolation

### Cargo_Route_Planning
use logic, planning and search to implement a system that efficiently moves cargo from their origins to their destinations using the least number of flights

### Sign_Language_to_Text
use Hidden Markov Models to translate sign language into their English language characters

### [Pac-man](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/project_overview.html)
build a Pac-Man AI that finds the most efficient path through its world

	* P1 - [Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/search.html): implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

	* P2 - [Multi-Agent Search](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/multiagent.html): implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

	* P3 - [Reinforcement Learning](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/reinforcement.html): implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

	* P4 - [Ghostbusters](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/tracking.html): implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.   

	* P5 - [Classification](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/classification.html): implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits then extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

	* P6 - [Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/contest.html): create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.  

### Simulated_Annealing
implement [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) between US state capitals

### Constraint_Satisfaction
use Backtracking to solve the N-queens problem (which is a generalization [8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle))
