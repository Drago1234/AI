# Machine Translation

Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline.

* text_processing (`text_processing.ipynb`): capture text data -> cleaning -> normalization -> tokenization -> stop word removal -> part-of-speech tagging -> named entity recognition -> stemming and lemmatization

* feature_extraction: transform text using Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec and GloVe, and use t-SNE to visualize word embeddings

* modeling: language models, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, search and ranking
