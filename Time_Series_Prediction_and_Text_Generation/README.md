# Time Series Prediction and Text Generation

Build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first we'll use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!

* Step 1: Implement a function to window time series
* Step 2: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform regression
* Step 3: Clean up a large text corpus
* Step 4: Implement a function to window a large text corpus
* Step 5: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform multiclass classification
* Step 6: Generate text using a fully trained RNN model and a variety of input sequences
