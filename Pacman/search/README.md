Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

`search.py` - the search algorithms  
`searchAgents.py` -	the search-based agents  
`pacman.py`	- the main file that runs Pacman games  
`game.py` - the logic behind how the Pacman world works  
`util.py` - useful data structures for implementing search algorithms
