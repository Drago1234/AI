# P4 - [Ghostbusters](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/tracking.html)

![busters](busters.png)

I can hear you, ghost. Running won't save you from my Particle filter! Implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.  

`bustersAgents.py` - agents for playing the Ghostbusters variant of Pacman   
`inference.py` - code for tracking ghosts over time using their sounds   
`busters.py` - the main entry to Ghostbusters (replacing `Pacman.py`)   
`bustersGhostAgents.py` - new ghost agents for Ghostbusters   
`distanceCalculator.py` - computes maze distances   
`game.py` - inner workings and helper classes for Pacman   
`ghostAgents.py` - agents to control ghosts   
`graphicsDisplay.py` - graphics for Pacman   
`graphicsUtils.py` - support for Pacman graphics   
`keyboardAgents.py` - keyboard interfaces to control Pacman   
`layout.py` - code for reading layout files and storing their contents   
`util.py` - utility functions
