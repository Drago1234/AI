analysis should conclude with a comparison of the different heuristics and your reasoning for choosing the heuristic you ultimately use in your submitted agent.

For each of your three custom heuristic functions, evaluate the performance of the heuristic using the included tournament.py script. Then write up a brief summary of your results, describing the performance of the agent using the different heuristic functions verbally and using appropriate visualizations.

The report makes a recommendation about which evaluation function should be used and justifies the recommendation with at least three reasons supported by the data.
