# Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

### Question 1 (Naked Twins)

Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: 


### Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)

Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: 


### Code

* `Sudoku.ipynb` - final project code for the Sudoku solver, includes solution and lecture notes 
* `solutions.py` - solution code skeleton
* `solution_test.py` - test solution by running `python solution_test.py`.
* `PySudoku.py` -  code for visualizing the solution.
* `visualize.py` - code for visualizing the solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the ```assign_values``` function provided in solution.py

### Data

The data consists of a text file of diagonal sudokus for you to solve.
