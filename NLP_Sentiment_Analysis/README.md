# Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks

Build an end-to-end sentiment classification system using a combination of RNNs and foundations of NLP. With the rise of online social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, we now have access, more than ever before, to massive text-based data sets that can be analyzed in order to determine how large portions of the population feel about certain products, events, etc. This sort of analysis, commonly referred to as sentiment analysis, is the subject of this project.
